        question: "How do I schedule my first Smart Waste Pickup?",
        answer: "To schedule a pickup, you must first register or log in to your account. Navigate to the 'Schedule Pickup' section in your dashboard, select your waste type and desired date, and confirm your request. Residential services require a logged-in account for verification.",
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What items are considered 'Hazardous Waste'?",
        answer: "Hazardous waste includes batteries, electronics (e-waste), fluorescent light bulbs, and certain paints or chemicals. These items should NEVER be placed in standard recycling or general waste bins. Please check our Waste Classification Guide for local drop-off points.",
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How can I earn Green Points through the Rewards Program?",
        answer: "Green Points are primarily earned by scheduling and successfully completing Smart Pickups. You earn bonus points for accurate sorting (verified by our AI system) and participating in community challenges or drives.",
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "What is the difference between Commercial and Industrial services?",
        answer: "Commercial services (SMEs, Schools, Hospitals) generally handle moderate volumes of municipal and non-hazardous specialized waste. Industrial services handle high-volume, complex waste streams (e.g., manufacturing byproducts, construction debris, heavy metals) requiring strict environmental compliance.",
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Why did I get a notification about sorting contamination?",
        answer: "Our AI sorting technology flagged an item in your bin that did not belong in that waste stream (e.g., food waste in a recycling bin). This notification is educational. Repeated contamination may affect your eligibility for bonus Green Points.",
    },
